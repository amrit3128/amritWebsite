# Who am I?

Here you are, folks. Welcome to my little world of the internet! I'm **Amrit**, a tech enthusiast from India seeking to restore my freedom through the use of software. My hobbies consist of experimenting with computers and exploring the world of Linux. Lately, I've tried getting into the world of Machine Learning.

I'm a proponent of free and open-source software, and I try to self-host as many services as possible. If you have any similar thoughts or would like to talk, feel free come forward and share them.
